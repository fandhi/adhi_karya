            <p style="margin-bottom:5px;">
                Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) represents an inherent part of the socalled ADHI principles, through which the Company aims to be:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A partner to communities in order to help and empower local economies to prosper and achieve sustainability, and thereby alleviate poverty.</li>

                <li>An initiator for the conservation of the environment.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b>SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY</b> <br />
                ADHI's Corporate Social Responsibility is espoused in the fifth point of the Company's mission, which is also pursuant to Law No. 40 on Limited Liability Company, Article 47 of Chapter V on Social and Environmental Responsibility, as well as the Minister of SOE Regulation PER-05/MBU/2007 that has been improved several times, the last of which is PER-08/MBU/2013 that regulates the Partnership and Community Development Program for state-owned enterprises.

            <p style="margin-bottom:5px;">
                In 2013, the Company pursued its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Partnership and Community Development Program (PCDP) activities as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>ADHI continued to support the Millenium Development Goals (MDG) program, specifically pertaining to its fourth and fifth targets, which are to "Reduce Child Mortality" and "Improve maternal Health."

The rainings aimed to enhance their skills and generally support their business, and were provided in collaboration with the local House of Alms.</li>
                <li>In cooperation with the Provincial Government of DKI (Jakarta). ADHI undertook a social program in the form of the Green House Program and improvements to several houses in the Cilincing community in North Jakarta.

                <li>In another MDG target, "Ensure Environmental Sustainability" that has a direct impact on communities as well as on future generations, ADHI cooperated with the City Hall of Bandung to help communities build biopores as both water encatchements and a hole to store organic</li>
                <li>CSR activities were also carried out by ADHI throughout Indonesia, as can be seen from the following table:</li>
