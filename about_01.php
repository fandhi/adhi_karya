                        <i>ADHI posted a net profit Rp 405.9 billion in 2013, almost doubling that of 2012 at Rp 211.5 billion.</i>

                    </p>

                </div>

            </div>            

            <p>

                First of all, allow me to begin my address with praises to God Almighty for His blessings. I am pleased to report that ADHI posted a net profit Rp405.9 billion in 2013, almost doubling that of 2012 at Rp 211.5 billion. Our growth in leaps and bounds, especially in the last five years as depicted in our financial highlights table, could only be achieved through the strong efforts among the Management and employees of ADHI, working smartly with integrity and modesty, as well as the support of our valued shareholders, not least of which is the government of the Republic of Indonesia through the Ministry of SOE as the majority shareholder.

            </p>

            <p>

                In accordance with the Long-Term Business Plan of ADHI 2012-2016, the Company plans for corporate activities in five business lines in order to increase the value of ADHI. Those business lines are Construction, EPC, Property, Realty and Investment in Infrastructure. In 2013, in addition to the Construction and EPC businesses, the Company has operated and profited from the Property and Realty businesses through two subsidiary entities, namely AdhiPersadaProperti (APP) and AdhiPersadaRealti (APR). These two subsidiaries had worked effectively and professionally, and in just two years of operations, both companies already posted a Net Profit – APP in the amount of Rp117.9 billion, and APR with a net profit of Rp75.4 billion.

            </p>

            <p>

                This shows that the value-oriented business development strategy of the Company, with the expansion of our operations into a cluster of five business lines, has proven to be effective. That is because all five business lines are founded upon the Company’s core competences, which are engineering and management.

            </p>

            <p>

                The Company will not expand into businesses that are not based upon engineering, at least not within the next three years, in order to maintain the quality as well as mitigate the risks associated with the growth of profitability.

            </p>

            <p>

                The encouraging performance of the Company in 2013 through the businesses of Construction, EPC, Property and Realty, the Company has also taken steps to establish two precast concrete plants consisting Western area in Sadang, and Eastern area, in Mojokerto. Initially, these operations are managed at divisional level. This initiative represents concrete steps by the Company and is consistent with its Investment in Infrastructure business, to support the growth of infrastructure construction, while also dedicated to supporting the monorail mode transportation business.

            </p>

            <p>

                The choice for precast concrete manufacture is based on the continuing development of ADHI’s experience as the managing contractor for the design and build of the Benoa Bali Toll Road, which today remains the only toll road constructed over the sea in Indonesia.

            </p>

            <p>

                From the point of view of market demand, the need for precast concrete has grown significantly in support of major infrastructure projects. Modern project management also requires applications in precast concrete technology that can enhance project executions, whether in the form of concrete piles or other products. In order to manage the business professionally, independent, and fast emerging, the Company plan to establish a new subsidiary namely AdhiPersadaBeton (APB).

            </p>

            <p>

                In another encouraging development, ADHI also views the monorail mode of transportation as a relevant business that can meet public demand for a mode of transportation that is free of traffic gridlock, efficient and operating timely. The Company is in the process of preparing all requirements, including alignment to prevailing laws, such as adding the business lines of rail-based and monorail transportation services provider into the Company’s Articles of Association and has been approved by the shareholders at the General Meeting of Shareholders held in April 2014. At present, the Company is also preparing a comprehensive program on the monorail, involving the business feasibility side, funding, legal aspect, technical operations and other resources.

            </p>

            <p>

                Expanding from the Property business base, the Company has also made plans to develop four-star hotels in Blok-M area Jakarta, and Surabaya; and three-star hotels in Bekasi and Medan. This move is designed to strengthen our Property business structure in the future, in addition to reap the benefit of recurring income. Meanwhile, in the Realty business, we are adopting a strategy of not only developing landed houses, but also managing commercial areas (malls, lifestyle centers and shopping complexes) also with the aim of strengthening our recurring income.

            </p>

            <p>

                In our core  business lines of construction and EPC services, our business development strategy is focused on continuously enhancing our professionalism through quality products and timely  deliveries. Here, the role of ALC (ADHI Learning Center) comes into the forefront. ALC has been in operations for more than a year, and its benefits are already felt. Through ALC, ADHI personnel are equipped with the passion to excel, and to always strive for quality by working intelligently and efficiently. With such passion, we form another subsidiary entity –specialize in building construction– AdhiPersadaGedung (APG).

            </p>

            <p>

                All this represent our main foundations to compete effectively in our business lines going forward, especially in the face of the ASEAN Free Market era that starts in 2015.

            </p>

            <p>

                The Company places a strong emphasis on Good Corporate Governance (GCG) and Management Information Systems (MIS). Good governance incorporates transparency, accountability, responsibility, independence and fairness. These principles are constantly instilled upon the awareness and understanding of each and every individual at ADHI, the results of which are validated by the audit program carried out by the Company’s Internal Audit Unit. At the same time, information management is also an integral part of GCG. As such the Company develops its MIS in support of the GCG program. The MIS is designed to maintain less direct interaction and transaction, both internally and with third-parties by developing a credible MIS.

            </p>

            <p>

                The Board of Directors believes that strong implementation of GCG, Transparency and MIS will create Company “competitiveness” in the future, and “to be a leading” in business competition in the ASEAN open market of the future.
