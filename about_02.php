                Ingenicure-Architecten-en- Annemersbedrijf Associatie Selle en de Bruyn, Reyerse en de Vries NV (Associate NV) is a Dutch-owned company which led to the establishment of ADHI until it was nationalized and later designated as PN Adhi Karya on March 11, 1960. Nationalization was a trigger for hyper infrastructure development in Indonesia. Based on the approval of the Minister of Justice of the Republic of Indonesia, on June 1, 1974, ADHI changed its status to Limited Liability Company. Until in 2004 ADHI has become the first construction company listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange.

            </p>

            <p>

                Status as a Limited Liability Company has encouraged ADHI to continue to provide the best service for all stakeholders, both in ADHI’s development and Indonesia’s construction industry that continues to grow. The intensity of  competition and price wars between the construction industries made the Company redefine its vision and mission: Becoming the Renowned Construction Company in Southeast Asia. This vision describes the motivation of the Company to move into other business related to the core business of the Company through a tagline that became the Company’s amplifier, namely “Beyond Construction”. Valuable and sustainable growth of the Company is one of the important aspects for ADHI to maintain and to provide the best to the public.

            </p>

            <p>

                ADHI has managed to show its ability as a leading construction company in Southeast Asia, through competitiveness and proven experience by running successful construction projects. ADHI could not have achieved success without the support and participation of the public. ADHI plays an active role in developing CSR programs as well as the Company’s Partnership and Environmental Preservation Program.
