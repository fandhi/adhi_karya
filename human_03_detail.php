                Technical support act as the link between a company's managers and the designers and developers who build their IT systems.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:5px;">
                As a technical support, you could work on projects ranging from planning the structure of a patient records database for the NHS, to the redesign of a building society’s online banking system. Your key responsibilities would be to make sure that each part of the overall IT system:

            <ul>
                <li>works together with the other parts as planned</li>
                <li>satisfies the requirements of the organisation</li>
                <li>meets the needs of the people who are going to use it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your main duties on a project would include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>identifying the organisation's needs</li>
                <li>breaking large system requirements down into manageable parts</li>
                <li>researching ‘off-the-shelf’ products to decide whether they would be more suitable than building a new system from scratch</li>
                <li>agreeing plans for the system’s structure with the client</li>
                <li>explaining the structure to the designers and developers, and helping them to build it</li>
                <li>developing and carrying out acceptance testing procedures to make sure systems are working properly</li>
                <li>making sure that systems meet quality standards and procedures</li>
                <li>advising senior IT managers about how to plan their future IT needs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You might specialise in a particular part of a system's framework (such as security), or you could be responsible for the entire structure, supervising a project team made up of architects, system analysts and developers.
